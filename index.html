                    <h3><time datetime="1881">1881</time>-<time datetime="1892">1892</time> - Early life</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was born to Kendra and Percival Dumbledore in the <time datetime="1881">summer of 1881</time>, in the village of Mould-on-the-Wold.
                        The early years of Dumbledore's life were marked by tragedy when his younger sister, <strong>Ariana Dumbledore</strong>, was attacked by a group of Muggle boys, who saw her performing magic and were frightened by what they saw.
                        Ariana was left mentally and emotionally scarred by the event and her magical powers were left severely altered and would manifest themselves on rare occasions usually in random or destructive ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Albus' father, Percival Dumbledore, was heartbroken and set out in search of his own brand of justice. He located the Muggle boys and attacked them, as they had his daughter.
                        For this, Percival was sentenced to Azkaban where he later died, choosing the sentence over explaining why he had attacked the boys as it would have meant Ariana being taken away.
                        To escape the accusing eyes, Kendra Dumbledore moved her young family to the <strong>village of Godric's Hollow</strong>.
                        Kendra rebuffed all her neighbours, with the eventual exception of Bathilda Bagshot, preferring to be left alone: and Albus learned not to mention his sister or father in public.

                    <h3><time datetime="1892">1892</time>–<time datetime="1899">1899</time> - Hogwarts years</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dumbledore began attending Hogwarts <time datetime="1892">in the autumn of 1892</time> and was sorted into <strong>Gryffindor</strong> house. His first year was met with much whispering about his father's crime.
                        Many of Albus' fellow students mistakenly believed that, like his father, Albus hated Muggles. Some praised his father's actions, hoping to gain his trust, but they would not find favour with the young Dumbledore this way.
                        Though later in his young life, under the influence of his love for Gellert Grindelwald, some anti-Muggle prejudice did develop, but he soon saw the error of his intent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He befriended a young Elphias Doge on his first day at Hogwarts; Doge was suffering from the aftermath of Dragon Pox at the time, which discouraged most from approaching him.
                        Dumbledore, however, demonstrated his uncommon <strong>kindness and willingness to look past the surface and find inner beauty in people</strong>.
                        Dumbledore also became very well-connected during his Hogwarts years, making notable friends such as <strong>Nicolas Flamel</strong>, <strong>Bathilda Bagshot</strong>, and <strong>Griselda Marchbanks</strong>, who later recalled that he did things with a wand that she had never seen before.
                        He also had several of his papers published during his studies and exchanged letters with theoretician <strong>Adalbert Waffling</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his third year, Dumbledore presumably took Study of Ancient Runes and at least one other subject, which is known not to be Divination.
                        During his fourth year, Dumbledore "accidentally" set the bed-curtains in his dormitory on fire (although he admitted that he had never liked them anyway).
                        Albus was made a prefect during his fifth year and was made Head Boy in his seventh year.
                        Over the course of his school career, Dumbledore also won the <strong>Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting</strong>, became the <strong>British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot</strong>, 
                        and received the <strong>Gold Medal for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo</strong>.

                    <h3><time datetime="1899">1899</time> - Tragedy and romance</h3>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Hogwarts <time datetime="1899-06">in June 1899</time>, Dumbledore planned to take the traditional "Grand Tour" of the world with his friend Doge.
                        However, tragedy ensued on the eve of the departure when Kendra Dumbledore was killed by an outburst of Ariana's uncontrollable magic, leaving Albus the head of his own broken family.
                        Albus returned to Godric's Hollow full of bitter resentment at his situation, feeling trapped and wasted, although he refused to let his <strong>younger brother Aberfoth</strong> quit school and insisted he complete his education before taking care of Ariana.
                        Fortune finally appeared to shine on Dumbledore, when a foreigner arrived at their village, by the name of <strong>Gellert Grindelwald</strong>.
                        A young man around Albus's age, he lived for the next two months with his great-aunt, the magical historian and family friend of the Dumbledores, <strong>Bathilda Bagshot</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thrilled to realise that the newcomer was every bit as brilliant as himself, the two young men took to each other right away and quickly struck up a close friendship, unified by the revelation of Grindelwald's research into the existence of the <strong>Deathly Hallows</strong>.
                        Dumbledore also quickly became fascinated by Grindelwald's ideas of <strong>wizarding domination</strong>, obviously considering Grindelwald an unexpected new chance to show his own brilliance and come out of the local misery.
                        Over the course of two months Grindelwald stayed in Godric's Hollow, the two young men’s friendship became romantic, with Albus ignoring any misgivings he had about Gellert's dark intents by convincing himself the revolution they were planning was truly <strong>For the Greater Good</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Aberforth angrily confronted him over his neglect of Ariana over the past few weeks, bluntly telling he couldn't carry out his plans with Grindelwald, as he would have to take her with him, which brought Albus back to reality despite not wanting to hear the truth of the words his younger brother shouted at him.
                        Grindelwald, however, furious with Aberforth's intervention, used the <strong>Cruciatus Curse</strong> on him. Moving to defend his brother, a violent duel erupted between the three teenage boys.
                        Ariana herself tried to intervene in the fight, and in the ensuing chaos was hit by a stray curse and died. No one knew whose curse it was that killed her, but Grindelwald fled immediately.
                        Aberforth resented Albus and they had a strained relationship, with Aberforth punching Albus and breaking his nose at Ariana's funeral. 
                        Aberforth never knew of the <strong>great guilt and regret</strong> Albus would feel for the rest of his life.

                    <h3><time datetime="1901">1901</time>-<time datetime="1925">1925</time> - Early career at Hogwarts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shortly thereafter, Albus travelled to France and spent some time in Paris studying the ancient art and science of alchemy under the tutelage of <strong>Nicholas Flamel</strong>. 
                        It is unknown when exactly he returned to Britain, but around the time he did, Albus had become intrigued with the study of dragon's blood, and was ultimately credited with the discovery of no less than twelve new uses for it. 
                        This accomplishment earned him widespread fame and recognition, and played no small role in the subsequent offer of employment that he received from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                        Having always felt drawn towards teaching himself, Albus was happy to accept.
                        Burdened by the secret knowledge of Grindelwald's imminent rise to power and wanting to rectify past mistakes, it was natural, that he felt drawn towards the job of <strong>Defence Against the Dark Arts</strong> instructor.

                    <h3><time datetime="1926">1926</time>-<time datetime="1945">1945</time> - Global Wizarding War</h3>
                    <p>
                        Together with his old student, <strong>Newt Scamander</strong>, Dumbledore discovered the <strong>Credence Barebone</strong>, the most powerful Obscurus ever recorded, but also contributed to the capture of Grindelwald, who had been disguised to find the Obscurus. 
                        <time datetime="1927">In 1927</time>, when Grindelwald had escaped, Dumbledore was longing to meet him, and at the same time was very afraid of it, because he knew that he was the only person who could stop Grindelwald, and he would face the truth about who is Ariana's killer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dumbledore also served in recruiting students for Hogwarts. Most prominent among the students he recruited was <strong>Tom Riddle</strong>, whom he found in Wool's Orphanage <time datetime="1938">in 1938</time>.
                        At an unknown point in or before <time datetime="1943">1943</time>, Dumbledore became the <strong>Professor of Transfiguration</strong>. 
                        <time datetime="1943">In 1943</time>, several Muggle-born students were mysteriously petrified by a beast rumoured to have been released by the Heir of Slytherin from the mythical <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong>. Indeed, the final victim of the beast was actually killed.
                        While Dumbledore rightly suspected Riddle was behind the attacks, the aspiring Dark Wizard expertly framed Gryffindor student Rubeus Hagrid as the perpetrator.
                        Dumbledore was never able to uncover hard evidence implicating Riddle, however, he nonetheless kept a very close watch over Riddle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Dumbledore was educating young wizards and witches, Gellert Grindelwald was still at large in Europe, building up his army, and had already found one of the Deathly Hallows, the <strong>Elder Wand</strong>, which he used to continue terrorising the continent.
                        Dumbledore was afraid Grindelwald could reveal to him that it had in fact been he himself who had cast the curse that killed Ariana. 
                        Having delayed pursuing him as long as he could, however, at the height of Grindelwald's power, <time datetime="1945">in 1945</time>, Albus could no longer in good conscience turn a blind eye to the many atrocities of Grindelwald. 
                        Upon finding Grindelwald, Dumbledore engaged him in the greatest duel ever fought. 
                        Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, and he was imprisoned, while Dumbledore kept the Elder Wand for himself. Celebrated worldwide as the hero, he was awarded the <strong>Order of Merlin (First Class)</strong>, by Leonard Spencer-Moon's administration.

                    <p>
                        Resuming his career following this legendary event, Dumbledore taught several other students over the years, some of which would become staunchly loyal to him and what he stood for, whereas others would become enemies, allying themselves with <strong>Lord Voldemort</strong>. 
                        It was also around this time that Dumbledore's name came up when the Hogwarts Board of Governors was faced with the decision of finding a suitable candidate to succeed Armando Dippet in the post of <strong>Headmaster</strong> and decided that the old Transfiguration teacher was the best man for the job.
                        Shortly after Dumbledore assumed the position, Tom Riddle, now known exclusively as Lord Voldemort, approached him with the same request he had proposed to Dippet before him, to be allowed to return to Hogwarts as a teacher.
                        Dumbledore, who knew of Voldemort's illicit activities since he left Hogwarts and suspected that he might have meant to use the position as means of recruiting more followers, turned down his application.

                    <h3><time datetime="1970">1970</time>-<time datetime="1981">1981</time> - First Wizarding War</h3>
                    <p>
                        After Lord Voldemort started his first rise to power <time datetime="1970">in 1970</time>, Dumbledore founded the <strong>Order of the Phoenix</strong>, a secret organisation of witches and wizards willing to risk their lives to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters.
                        Later on in the war, Dumbledore was approached by another person who also wanted a job at Hogwarts: <strong>Sybill Trelawney</strong>, who applied to become the new professor of Divination. 
                        Dumbledore gave her a chance because she was the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney. To his disappointment, when he was interviewing Sybill at the Hog's Head, he came to the conclusion that she was not a real Seer. 
                        However, as Dumbledore was about to leave, Trelawney fell into a real trance and made a <strong>Prophecy</strong> about the birth of the one that would have the power to vanquish the Dark Lord, who would be born to those <i>who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies</i>. 
                        This astonished Dumbledore, but as it turned out, the Death Eater <strong>Severus Snape</strong> had overheard most of the Prophecy but had been caught in the act of spying and ejected from the tavern by Aberforth Dumbledore. Dumbledore hired Trelawney in order to protect her from the Death Eaters.

                    <h3><time datetime="1981">1981</time>-<time datetime="1995">1995</time> - Between the wars</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shortly before the Potters' deaths, Dumbledore discovered that James's <strong>Cloak of Invisibility</strong> was, in fact, one of the Deathly Hallows. 
                        Although Dumbledore had long given up his desire to unite the Hallows and become Master of Death, he could not resist the thought of studying the Cloak.
                        Later, Severus Snape approached Dumbledore, having already told Voldemort about the Prophecy. Snape was shocked by the fact that Voldemort had concluded that the Prophecy was about Harry Potter, the son of James Potter, and Snape's own loved childhood friend, <strong>Lily Evans</strong>. 
                        Dumbledore agreed to protect Potters, on the basis that Snape worked as a double agent for the Order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presumably well aware that Voldemort wasn't truly vanquished after his fall, Dumbledore made sure that Harry would be kept safe with his family, the Dursleys.
                        He convinced Snape to help him protect Harry, although years later Dumbledore secretly planned to allow Voldemort to kill Harry in the end, which would destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul inside him.
                        However, he also hoped to influence Harry into such a person who would willingly sacrifice his life for the greater good, allowing him the chance to choose between life and death in the end.
                        Shortly thereafter, Dumbledore gave Snape employment at Hogwarts as the Potions master, and later defended Snape against the Ministry of Magic. 
                        Dumbledore attended many Death Eater trials, including that of the <strong>Lestranges</strong> and <strong>Barty Crouch, Jr</strong>. He was also a witness to <strong>Igor Karkaroff's</strong> testimony. 
                        With Harry safe and certain members of the Order of the Phoenix keeping watch over him, Dumbledore continued his work as the brilliant if eccentric Headmaster of his beloved school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ten years after Dumbledore left Harry Potter with his uncle and aunt, Harry started attending Hogwarts. That year, Lord Voldemort formulated a plan to regain human form. 
                        Dumbledore and his friend Nicolas Flamel (the only known maker of the <strong>Philosopher's Stone</strong>) began to suspect that the disembodied Dark Lord was plotting to steal the invaluable object, which would be capable of restoring him to full power. 
                        He had the stone moved to a medium security vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, but later had it moved to Hogwarts itself.
                        Together with several teachers at Hogwarts, Dumbledore planted magical security methods to keep safe the stone. In the end it was Harry who protected the Philosopher's Stone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime before the next year began, Dumbledore, having never been fooled by <strong>Gilderoy Lockhart's</strong> tall tales, figured out the truth soon when Lockhart erased the memories of two wizards that Dumbledore personally knew. 
                        He realised that Lockhart had gone too far and decided to track him down and make him pay for his crimes. 
                        Having the position of the Professor of the Defence Against the Dark Arts vacant proved to be useful for Dumbledore, as he offered Lockhart the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly into the school year of <time datetime="1992">1992</time>, students again fell under attack from a beast allegedly released from the Chamber of Secrets.
                        Under the influence of <strong>Lucius Malfoy</strong>, the Hogwarts board of governors voted to remove Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster when he proved unable to uncover the culprit.
                        However, Harry Potter was able to find the Chamber himself, and there, defeated Salazar Slytherin's basilisk and the nearly fully formed memory of Riddle. 
                        Dumbledore mysteriously returned to his position as Headmaster after the memory of Riddle was revealed as being behind the attacks. 
                        However, Dumbledore was privately concerned by the phenomena that Harry described; a mere memory capable of taking physical form was unheard of. 
                        Dumbledore then began to suspect that Riddle's diary was in fact a <strong>Horcrux</strong>, and furthermore, considering the lack of care the Dark Lord had taken in protecting the diary, that he had created more than one.

                    <h3><time datetime="1995">1995</time>–<time datetime="1997">1997</time> - Second Wizarding War</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Ministry of Magic immediately began to deny Dumbledore's claims that the Dark Lord had returned, starting a smear campaign designed to slander and vilify him. 
                        Dumbledore was removed from his positions as <strong>Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot</strong> and <strong>Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards</strong> as punishment for his refusal to stay in line with Ministry propaganda.
                        Before the beginning of the school year, Dumbledore was made <strong>Secret-Keeper of the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix</strong>.
                        Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley created an organisation that was known as <strong>Dumbledore's Army</strong>. When this illegal society was uncovered, Dumbledore willingly took the blame. 
                        While <strong>Fudge</strong> ordered his arrest, he stated that he <i>would not come quietly and easily overpowered his would-be captors with a single spell</i>, and went underground; working to aid the Order full-time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Near the end of the <strong>battle with the Death Eaters</strong>, Dumbledore himself arrived and swiftly captured all the Death Eaters, except <strong>Bellatrix Lestrange</strong>. 
                        After binding the Death Eaters, Dumbledore went to the atrium of the Ministry where Lestrange had been joined by Voldemort himself, who attempted to kill Harry.
                        Voldemort's curse, however, was prevented; Dumbledore quickly animated a golden statue to cover Harry and shield him from the curse. He animated the other statues from the <strong>Fountain of Magical Brethren</strong> to immobilise Bellatrix and alert Ministry officials. 
                        With Voldemort having arrived in the Ministry, Dumbledore took this chance to give undeniable evidence that the Dark Lord truly had returned. 
                        Dumbledore displayed his <strong>extraordinary magical capabilities</strong> as he calmly countered or dodged Voldemort‘s attacks and returned with his own assault that steadily forced Voldemort to go on the defensive, yet Dumbledore was not fighting to kill, a fact which surprised Voldemort. 
                        Soon enough, Dumbledore managed to trap the Dark Lord within an orb of water just after having been saved by Fawkes, who intercepted a killing curse Voldemort has shot at Dumbledore while the latter was countering the strike of a fiery serpent that Voldemort had conjured. 
                        Though Dumbledore had failed to capture or defeat Voldemort, the Dark Lord realised himself that he could not overpower his former teacher, and so abandoned his effort and disapparated.

                        During the summer of <time datetime="1996">1996</time>, Dumbledore tracked one of Voldemort's Horcruxes to the house of the Gaunts.
                        When he found the Horcrux, a <strong>ring formerly owned by Marvolo Gaunt</strong>, he saw that the stone in the ring was one of the Deathly Hallows, the <strong>Resurrection Stone</strong>.
                        His desire to see his family overrode his common sense for just a moment and he placed the ring on his finger, forgetting that the ring had been cursed by Voldemort.
                        The <strong>curse</strong> quickly spread, and were it not for his own prodigious talents, he would have died within moments. Despite this injury, Dumbledore proceeded to destroy the ring, and with it, a piece of Voldemort's soul.
                        The skills of Snape managed to trap the curse in Dumbledore's hand. However, both Snape and Dumbledore knew that it would eventually spread to the rest of his body. 
                        Knowing that the curse would kill him, Dumbledore asked Snape, that when the time came, that he be the one to end Dumbledore's life, rather than <strong>Draco Malfoy</strong>.

                        Throughout the <time datetime="1996">1996</time>–<time datetime="1997">1997</time> school year, Dumbledore passed on certain pieces of information to Harry Potter that would be important for the boy in his quest to destroy the Dark Lord. 
                        Dumbledore held private lessons with Harry, revealing in them much of what he had learnt about Voldemort's past, life and Horcruxes.
                        After much searching, Dumbledore eventually tracked another of Voldemort's Horcruxes to a cave that as a young orphan, he had once visited. As he had promised, Dumbledore allowed Harry Potter to accompany him and help destroy the Horcrux.
                        Setting off from Hogwarts on an evening <time datetime="1997-06">in early June 1997</time>, he and Harry apparated to just outside the cave.
                        Once inside, Dumbledore located a hidden doorway which only opened when it received an offering of blood. They next found themselves in a vast chamber containing an underground lake with a solitary island at its centre. 
                        Dumbledore located a carefully concealed boat that would allow them safe passage across the lake, which was filled with <strong>Inferi</strong>. 
                        Arriving at the island, they found a basin filled with <strong>glowing green potion</strong>. Dumbledore ordered Harry to help him drink all of the potion, no matter what effects it caused.
                        Dumbledore drank and he saw a vision of the duel between him, Grindelwald and Aberforth Dumbledore and Ariana's death. The drink was weakening him and made him extremely thirsty as well and caused him great pain. 
                        He couldn't bear it, but Harry succeeded at getting it down this throat. After the period of unconsciousness, Dumbledore woke up wanting water. 
                        In desperation, Harry filled a cup with water from the lake. After Dumbledore drank it, the Inferi climbed up from the lake and attempted to kill them. Harry panicked and attempted to fight back with a multitude of spells and curses, but none of them worked. 
                        Dumbledore, having regained consciousness, created a ring of fire around them that repelled the Inferi, driving them back into the lake while he and Harry escaped in the boat with the <strong>Horcrux</strong>.

                        As the <strong>Battle of the Astronomy Tower</strong> had already begun, Harry and Dumbledore flew to the Astronomy Tower, where Dumbledore and an invisibility-cloaked Harry were confronted by <strong>Draco Malfoy</strong>. 
                        Before Harry could reveal himself, Dumbledore immobilised him with a silent Full Body-Bind Curse.
                        Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore, and admitted that he, Draco, was behind the series of attacks on students, and that <strong>Voldemort had ordered him to kill Dumbledore</strong>. 
                        Dumbledore revealed that he knew of Draco's mission and of the attempts on his life, but allowed him to remain in Hogwarts for knowing Voldemort would kill him if he was exposed and expelled. 
                        Dumbledore offered Draco protection, and promised to hide Draco and his mother where Voldemort would never find them. Draco ultimately could not bring himself to kill the Headmaster. 
                        However, Snape arrived into the Tower and, after Dumbledore pleaded with him, in a way that did not expose Snape's true intentions, killed the Headmaster, blasting his body off the tower and falling to the ground below.
                        Sometime <time datetime="1997-07">in early July</time>, a funeral was held for him, attended by Hogwarts students and staff, Ministry of Magic officials, centaurs, members of the Order of the Phoenix, Hogsmeade residents including Dumbledore’s brother Aberforth, as well as many other witches and wizards.
